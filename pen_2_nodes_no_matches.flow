c  A flow network with penalization for each node without an outbound or incoming arc.  In this 
c  example, there is a penalty of one for each such node.  Obviously these penalties could be 
c  anything, including a custom penalty on a per-node basis.  One example of this would be the 
c  opposite of the maximum cost.
c
c  For bipartite subgraphs comprised only of nodes connected by negative-cost arcs, we can 
c  obviously choose different penalization strategies for the two disjoint subsets of nodes when
c  the nodes in those subsets don't have inbound or outbound arcs in the solution.  This is helpful
c  for one-way matching (rather than two-way matching).
c
c  Since the total penalty for two nodes not having an arc is 2, it IS NOT enough to overcome the 
c  advantage of delivering fewer arcs to fewer nodes. The total cost is -3 = -5 + 1 + 1, and only
c  arc e(3, 4) is delivered.  If we delivered arcs e(2, 4) and e(3, 5), the total cost would be 
c  -2 = -1 + -1, which is suboptimal.
c
c  Notice there is only one penalty arc coming from or going to each non-source, non-sink node.
c  This is because the match limits for each of these nodes is one.  So, either an arc can be drawn
c  between such nodes or not.  If no arc is connected to a node, then flow must go through the 
c  penalty arc.  If there was a potential for more matches and we wanted to only induce penalties
c  for nodes with no outgoing or incoming arcs, then we would have two edges to/from the nodes in 
c  question.  One arc would have a capacity of the node's flow capacity minus 1 and would have 0 
c  cost.  The second node would have capacity 1 and whatever penalty is desired for having no arcs
c  associated with the node.
c
c  The following is the graphical depiction of the flow network that is specified below.

c
c  NOTE: All edge labels are in the format:
c
c            <capacity lower bound> <capacity upper bound> <cost>.  
c
c        The labels are written above or to the side of the arcs to which they pertain.  The arcs
c        while missing arrow heads are directed and always flow from left to right.  The flow 
c        network has a total flow of 2 to the source, denoted s with ID 0, and -2 from the sink, 
c        denoted t with ID 1.  Note that negative arc costs indicate arcs we'd like to see 
c        delivered in the final solution and positive costs indicate penalties.  Arcs with zero 
c        costs are present merely induce the proper amount of flow through nodes.
